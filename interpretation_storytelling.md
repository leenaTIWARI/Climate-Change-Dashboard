## 1. ðŸ“ˆ Line Chart: Global Temperature Anomaly Over Time

**File:** visuals/line_temp_trend.html

- The chart shows a consistent upward trend in temperature anomalies since the 1880s.
- Post-1980s, the rate of increase becomes notably steep, signaling accelerated global warming.
- This reinforces the evidence of climate change as a long-term and worsening issue.

## 2. ðŸ“¦ Box Plot: Decadal Temperature Variability

**File:** visuals/boxplot_decade.png

- Every decade shows a higher median temperature anomaly than the one before.
- The 2010s have fewer outliers and consistently high anomalies.
- Indicates a shift not only in averages but also in the stability of warmer conditions.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Heatmap: Correlation Between Climate Indicators

**File:** visuals/correlation_heatmap.png

- Strong positive correlations are visible between COâ‚‚ levels, temperature anomalies, and sea level rise.
- Negative correlation with polar ice extent.
- Suggests carbon emissions are a significant driver of climate change.

## 4. âœ¨ Interactive Scatter Plot: Year-wise Anomalies

**File:** visuals/interactive_temp.html

- Enables exploration of trends by decade or year using dropdown filters.
- Reveals sharper rises during industrial growth periods and dips during global slowdowns (e.g., WWII).
- Engages the user in understanding data patterns interactively.
